                <p>
                    Key member of <em>Backend Foundry squad / Infrastructure team</em>, responsible for spearheading adoption and
                    implementation of architectural solutions enabling Eventbrite to operate at scale, while helping engineers
                    move faster.<br/>
                    Most significant projects:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Driven deprecation of hard-coded checks in favor of robust, fully dynamic permissions' system.
                            Worked closely with consumer, internal audit, and security teams to enable company-wide adoption.
                            Developed tools and best practices enabling engineers.
                            <em>Key results:</em> enabled consumer teams to serve complex, high value customers.</li>
                        <li>Requirements gathering, design and implementation of Cerberus, Eventbrite's new generation
                            Authentication, Authorization and Identification service driving the new permissions system.
                            Coordinated with SRE and BDRE on SLA/SLO budgets & monitoring for this mission critical system.
                            <em>Key results:</em> receiving most traffic, Cerberus is the most stable and reliable of Eventbrite's services.</li>
                        <li>Design, implementation and enabling adoption of PySOA, in-house SOA bus, which enabled migration
                            of monolith into service oriented architecture.
                            <em>Key results:</em> remote service call latency reduced from 20-30ms to 1-2ms, while also enabling
                            multiplexing. About 70% of the monolith code migrated into microservices.</li>
                        <li>Developed Dilithium, in-house event-sourcing based on parsing MySQL binlog, using rules to
                            generate high-level events from row level changes. Productionized prototype, making it resilient and
                            scalable. <em>Key results:</em> enabled teams to use with ease, making service robust enough to withstand
                            on-sales generating in excess of 5,000 updates a second, absorbing the peaks into Kafka, thus not
                            overwhelming consumers.</li>
                        <li>In Architecture Guild, authored architectural proposals and engineering best practices, driving their
                            approval and adoption throughout the organization</li>
